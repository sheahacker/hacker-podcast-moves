# Common Moves of Podcasting

## Podcasts I explored
I chose investigative podcasts for this assignment, because I had listened to them before and found them very interesting.

The first one I chose was Criminal, an online podcast costed by Phoebe Judge, who records short episodes and investigates a different case in each one. I listened to the first episode, which was called Animal Instincts. The episode was about a case where a woman had been found by her husband bleeding to death at the bottom of the staircase in their home. The husband ended up being convicted of the murder, but a fellow neighbor, who was a lawyer himself went a little deeper to discover and believe that an owl was actually the reason for the woman's death.

The second podcast I chose was Someone Knows Something on CBC Radio, hosted by David Ridgen. This podcast focuses on one case alone the whole season. I listened to episode one, titled The Family. The case in season one was about the disappearance of a five year old boy from a fishing trip with his father and brother, back in 1972 in the hometown of Ridgen. In the first episode, Ridgen talked with the family to try to figure out what was going on the day the boy went missing, how it might have happened, and what their theories are.
