# Common Moves of Podcasting

## Podcasts I Explored:
I chose investigative podcasts for this assignment, because I had listened to them before and found them very interesting. Both podcasts follow criminal cases. The first one was Criminal, which follows a different case in every episode, which are usually short and good for quick listens. The second podcast was Someone Knows Something on CBC Radio, which follows just one case in the first season.

## Podcast one: Criminal
Criminal is an online podcast hosted by Phoebe Judge, who records short episodes and investigates a different case in each one. I listened to the first episode, which was called Animal Instincts. The episode was about a case where a woman had been found by her husband bleeding to death at the bottom of the staircase in their home. The husband ended up being convicted of the murder, but a fellow neighbor, who was a lawyer himself went a little deeper to discover and believe that an owl was actually the reason for the woman's death.

The podcast begins with a man talking, who is not the host. There is music playing in the background, giving the podcast a dramatic feel. He's telling a story about running in the woods and losing his hat, but having no idea how. The host then comes on to introduce herself as Phoebe Judge, and introduces the podcast. She quickly gets into the story. Music is still playing in the background as the describes the horrific scene of 48 year old Kathleen Peterson lying dead at the bottom of a staircase in a pool of her own blood. She then plays the 911 call her husband made when he discovered her around 3 am, thinking that she fell down the stairs. The music has stopped playing at this point, as she gives a brief summary of the trial, stating that the husband was convicted of her murder.

Music plays again, indicating a transition. Phoebe starts to speak again, talking about a next door neighbor and lawyer who followed the case very carefully and came up with his own idea of what happened. She recites the theory that he gave to the police, saying that an owl was responsible for her death, by attacking her when she was outside and ripping hair and flesh off her scalp, causing her to panic and run inside where she slipped at the bottom of the stairs and knocked herself unconscious. She then plays a recording of the neighbor explaining how this was possible. While he is talking, she occasionally interjects to explain. Once he is done talking, music plays again, indicating another transition.

We then find out that the blood analyst in the trial lied about his credentials, so the husband is now free from jail awaiting another trial. She transitions again with music and proceeds to talk about man and animal. She introduces her producer, and then plays a long recording of a story he is telling about man vs animal. Throughout his whole story, music occasionally plays whenever he pauses. Once he finishes his story, the music gets louder. Phoebe speaks, ending the podcast as the music ends.

### Structure
- Begins the podcast with a story that hooks the listener (similar to a hook in an essay or story).
- Introduces herself as the host and the podcast before going into the subject.
- Music is played for every transition onto a different topic.
- Music is also used for dramatic effect. Eerie or slower music is played when more serious topics are talking about.
- Uses clips of recorded stories or testimonies.
- Uses recordings of other interviews to prove a point.
- Interjects during recorded speech to explain something that might be unclear or follow up on it.
- At the end, closes off by repeating her name and the name of producers and the podcast.


## Podcast two: Someone Knows Something
Someone Knows Something is a podcast on CBC Radio, hosted by David Ridgen. This podcast focuses on one case alone the whole season. I listened to episode one, titled The Family. The case in season one was about the disappearance of a five year old boy from a fishing trip with his father and brother, back in 1972 in the hometown of Ridgen. In the first episode, Ridgen talked with the family to try to figure out what was going on the day the boy went missing, how it might have happened, and what their theories are.

The podcast began with the sound of car doors opening and closing, seat belts clicking and a car starting and driving away. Music then began to play, and a woman introduced the podcast, stating "You're listening to Someone Knows Something, from CBC Radio." The woman, who is not the host, dives into a quick summary of the case they'll be studying this season, which is the disappearance of a five year old boy from a fishing trip back in 1972. She then introduces the host and documentarian, David Ridgen, who grew up in the same town the boy went missing from, and has decided to head back to his hometown to investigate. Music plays again and the car sounds again, indicating a transition and the start of a new section.

You hear a recording of a knock on a door, and people introducing themselves. The audio fades out and Ridgen speaks, explaining where he is and what he's doing. He's visiting the family of the boy who went missing years ago, Adrien McNaughton. There is still music playing as the first audio fades back in for a moment and you hear the voices again. It fades out again for the host to speak. This happens a few times before it focuses on the family. They are speculating on what happened to Adrien, the rumors that circled their family and how they just want to know what happened to him at some point in their life. Music is still playing, and gets louder to indicate a transition.

Ridgen uses an audio clip of a heartbeat to give dramatic impact as he begins to speak about what might have happened to 5 year old Adrien, and that someone knows something. Recordings of various townsfolk and witnesses speculating on what happened is played, and music is played agains as a transition. Recordings of family members is played of them remembering Adrien. Music plays, and you hear the sound of a car again. Ridgen says they are going to visit the place where Adrien went missing with the father and sister of Adrien. Music plays and car sounds again, and the recording of the host and the family at the lake where the boy went missing plays again. You can hear footsteps crunching on the ground as they speak.

### Structure
- Begins with the sounds of car doors opening, which is audio used again when Ridgen is in the car with the father and sister of Adrien.
- Music plays as a transition between scenes.
- A woman, who is not the host, introduces the whole point and plot of the podcast series, and then introduces the host and documentarian.
- The podcast goes back and forth between scenes and uses signals like car doors shutting, footsteps, heartbeats and knocking on doors to signal the transition back to a certain scene.
- The podcast ends with the woman speaking again, telling listeners to go on their website for more information, and gives a sneakpeak to the next week.
